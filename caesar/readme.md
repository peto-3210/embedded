Usage:
 Program reads the input from stdin and prints the ciphered output to stdout.
To perform cipher operation, you must provide a seed (number of positions each character should be rotated by).
The seed must be provided as a first argument of the program (if not, default value is 10).
To decipher message, you must provide a seed with value opposite to the original seed.
(If message was ciphered by seed 4, it may be deciphered using seed -4).
